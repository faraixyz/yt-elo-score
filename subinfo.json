Do not question this; it is essential to being a good historian.\n\nThe best \"About\" section you can find on me and not written by me are my videos, so if you want to learn more about me why not watch them? If you still want to learn more then consider jumping into my private life on Vlogs in Clogs, or following my various social media accounts like Facebook or Twitter, and if you want to pay me to ramble about history and languages and sitting in my room fantasising about windmills; you now can thanks to popular demand by becoming a patron on Patreon.

I also taught college courses in world history either part or full time for a decade.\n\nWhy \"Premodernist\"?\nThe channel name, \"premodernist\", isn't a pre-existing word and has no established meaning. I'm using it as a riff on how academic historians label each other. For example, if your research is in U.S. history, then in academic history circles you're an Americanist. If your research is in medieval Europe, then you're a medievalist. I picked the term \"premodernist\" to reflect that I'm mainly interested in the more distant past (not recent history as much) but I don't like to confine myself to one region. It isn't a real history specialization because by definition it isn't specific.\n",

Steph is from Guangzhou and loves cooking food from throughout China - you'll usually be watching her behind the wok.  Chris is a long-term expat from America that's been living in China and loving it for the last 12 years - you'll be listening to his explanations and recipe details.\n\nThis channel is all about learning how to cook the same taste that you'd get in China. Our goal for each video is to give you a recipe that would at least get you close to what's made by some of our favorite restaurants here.  Because of that, our recipes are no-holds-barred Chinese when it comes to style and ingredients - but feel free to ask for tips about adaptations and sourcing too!",

We have already covered more than 200 different airlines and are continuing to expand the list so that one day you can point at any aircraft and can be sure we have a report about what it's like to fly on it!\n\nSince we want to be as useful as possible to everyone, we are also operating a Flickr library with countless pictures that everyone can use for any purpose, including commercial purposes. We only ask for a small attribution if used for commercial purposes like on the news or in blogs.\n\nWe also value transparency a lot. This is why you'll find the price of each flight in the description of the video. We also post information regarding the flight itself, the cameras used and possible collaborations there.\n\nShould you still have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to contact us at info (at) simply-aviation.com.",

During the day, I am an attorney who works on cases involving victims of domestic violence, victims of human trafficking, and refugees. \n\nAfter long, grueling days, I would often watch video-essays and relax, but couldn't find a channel that had what I was looking for: content that was serious without being anxiety-inducing, mature without being condescending, and wholesome without being overbearing. \n\nAnd so, I decided to make my own, as a hobby! Now, by night, I make wholesome, relaxing, and hopefully enjoyable, video essays, mostly about video games and law. Life has always been a struggle for me... and if it has been for you too, maybe you can join me on this YouTube journey. \n\nThank you for tuning in to Moon Channel. It means so much to me! \n\n- Moony \n",

My focus is primarily on Sydney, Australia, and planning decisions over the past 50 years that have shaped our great city, for worse or for better.\n\nWatch my channel for reviews of the plannings of different suburbs across Sydney, for stories about railways and freeways lost to time, and for analysis of upcoming government infrastructure proposals!\n\nI really hope you enjoy my channel; I'm putting a lot of work into it, and I hope it will truly become your go-to destination for infrastructure stories from Sydney (and maybe more one day)!\n\nView the links below to support me with donations at Ko-Fi, or to follow me on Instagram or Twitter!\n",

I am a director and cinematographer with a University degree in Film and Literary studies, which is why I love to discuss broad topics and talk about all kinds of movies. I firmly believe that learning more about cinema can give you so much more enjoyment from movies and will make you appreciate the art a little bit more.\n\nBut, what does 'Du Cinema' mean? Well, it's inspired by the famous and well respected French movie magazines titled Cahiers Du Cinema, meaning 'notebooks on cinema'. It was founded in the 1950's and included essays of influential filmmakers and film critics. The literal translation is \"from cinema\", the place where it all starts 🎥. \n\n",

I do a little advisory work for startups too.\n\nIf you want to get in touch, drop me a line but please read these two things first:\n\n1. I don't do paid reviews.

Although there are a million recipe videos out there, I really hope to find ways to experiment with unique ingredients, techniques and develop cool stuff through trial and error.\n\nI really want to create an environment where it is not frowned up on to make mistakes and to learn together. I derive so much pleasure and relaxation from cooking and experimenting, and I would like to share that, as well as keeping a record for myself. I feel like the environment of Youtube cooking channels tend to have a condescending tone (not all of them), and I hope to go against some of that with this blog/channel. I want to emphasize that I am not a professional cook, and there should be no gap between you and me.",

For now, they rate the tool's specs with the battery they provide so we test vs that. \n\nWhat air set-up do you have?\nIR 80gal compressor - 20ft 1\" cast iron pipe to 3ft 3/4\" pipe threaded into wall regulator (48 CFM max), 3/8\" NPT out to  3/8\" 25ft hose. 1/4\" Milton V Hi-Flo Pro fittings and Milton 5in1 hi-flo coupler (67 CFM max)\n\nWhy do you test up to 15 seconds (that's too long, too short): \nSee ep1, there's a standard for impact testing. \n\nCan I send you a tool and you send back?\nYes! TorqueTestChannel at gmail.com\n\nWhy not use a torque wrench?\nSee ep3 on nut-busting. \n\nIt's technically \"pounds-foot\" though\nWe tried saying it that way, it's pretty laborsome after awhile. \n\n\n\n",

There is so much amazing science and engineering that gets done, but most often the only ones who get to experience it first hand are those in expensive labs in universities. This channel aims to explore as much of fields of science and engineering as possible by showing real experiments and research being done in a fun and accessible way. While the goal is to show that even very hard science can be done in a DIY way, some projects will use some of the fancier toys that while less accessible, opens a broader range of projects that can be done. We cover everything from genetic engineering and tissue culture, to nuclear physics, to machine engineering, to chemical synthesis and more.",

At ScienceABC we believe that if science is communicated simply and made relatable and fun, it can be for everyone. As Micheal Jackson said best, \"as simple as ABC.\"\n\nSo far, we've tackled complex and vast topics like Einstein's Time Dilation, the Immune System, Evolution, Quantum Entanglement, while also asking the questions that nag us at night like \"Is the science in the movies accurate?\", \"Is it possible to have insects the size of humans?\", and \"Why can I hear a thundering sound in my ear?\"\n\nSo, join us for some simple science with a whole lot of fun thrown in! Subscribe to our channel for your weekly dose of science and don't forget to share our work if you liked it. \n\nTo know more about us, check this link: https://www.scienceabc.com/about-us",

Soon after starting the channel, I was shocked/delighted by the number of viewers who were enthusiastic about the topics I was covering. Quickly, I had more video ideas than I knew what to do with! (Still do.)\n\nEvery aspect of CityNerd is currently produced by yours truly (Ray Delahanty). Research, writing, on-camera \"talent\" (cough cough), editing, engaging with viewers....yeah, it's all me. I'll update this description just as soon as I hire a crack team of researchers and cinematographers.\n\nCheck out my social media links if you're looking for more (yeah that's all me, too), and reach out to Nerd email re: collaboration, sponsorship, etc. Thanks!\n\n",

I've covered things from Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra to Kendrick Lamar verses and the musical Hamilton, so you can expect me to talk about a wide range of topics. If this interests you, hang around; there might be something cool for you here. \n\nMany videos on this channel were edited by Jesse Guarascia.

I have a long list, and yeah I actually have a list of videos that I want to make in the future. I constantly update that list and post it in the community tab monthly. My patreons then vote on which topic comes next. The process by which I currently work is to make a short video (about 12-30 minutes long) followed by a long video (about 1-2 hours long) and to try to do two videos a month. I hope you enjoy what I have made if you want to leave feedback or criticism and you want me to see it, there is a feedback tab on my discord server where I read and take note on what my audience believes should be changed,or what I got wrong, or take suggestions for topics.\nIf you want to suggest a topic, leave feedback or support me via paypal or patreon, the links are below. If you want to contact me in person the best way is through discord.",

Have some fun and learn to think like a lawyer.  \n\nI get asked a lot about whether being a practicing attorney is like being a lawyer on TV.  I love watching legal movies and courtroom dramas.  It's one of the reasons I decided to become a lawyer.  But sometimes they make me want to pull my hair out because they are ridiculous.  So I created this channel to answer your burning questions about the law and the legal profession.  While all legal movies and shows take dramatic license to make things more interesting (nobody wants to see hundreds of hours of brief writing), many of them have a grain of truth.  Learn everything you always wanted to know about being an attorney!\n\nIf you’re a law student or thinking about law school, check out my other channel made specifically for law students and 0Ls here: https://goo.gl/e3kEHL",

Throughout the 20-part video series, we'll examine the banking system and see how that system has changed over the years and why. We'll see how changes to the banking system have affected the economy, and also average people trying to make ends meet. We'll also see how people through the years have organized to enact changes to our financial and economic systems.\n\nPhoto of Occupy Wall Street Bank of America protest taken by Magnus Manske and uploaded to Flickr.com under a creative commons license [CC BY-SA 2.0]\n",

Business inquiries can be directed to the address below.\n\nI'm best known for the series Everything is a Remix, which was primarily popular on the Vimeo platform and has since been removed for consuming excess bandwidth (humblebrag). The original series ran from 2010 - 2012 and was given a minor update in 2015. The series was rebooted in 2021 and ran until 2023. The Everything is a Remix series has been seen at least several million times. I've lost track.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2020 (yikes) I created the full-length doc This is Not a Conspiracy Theory.\n\nMy early videos were sketch comedy then solo comedic video blogs. I worked under the name Goodie Bag TV then.\n\nMy mailing list is the best way to keep up with me: https://kirbyferguson.ck.page/93185dc305\nIf you'd like you support my new pursuits, come back me on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/kirbyferguson\n\n",

In the meantime, we hope you will enjoy the hours of experimentation!\n\n",

I was raised a missionary kid but no longer believe in the supernatural. I grew up in a former Soviet, Muslim country right after the fall of the Berlin Wall. My love of science made me question everything, and I'm a skeptic of all things paranormal now. I'm a people-loving humanist with a child-like awe of the cosmos.\n\nI try to base all of my videos on the pillars of free thought, critical thinking, and scientific skepticism. Freely question everything, because truth withstands scrutiny.\n\nYou can be free! Dare to be curious and don't drink the Koolaid!",
